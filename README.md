The notebook "Loan_Prediction-Copy1.ipynb" was part of machine learning assessment for Blucognition : Data Scientist job.

The notebook "Loan_Prediction.ipynb", I have submitted this on "datahack.analyticsvidhya.com". I have got a score of 0.77 on test data with a rank of 3393. I will try to improve the score by using better feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and better model selection.
